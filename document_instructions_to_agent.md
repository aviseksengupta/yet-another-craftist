# Documentation of the Craft Full Space API

## Craft – Full Space API for API for All Documents

**Version:** 1.0.0

### Overview
The Craft Space API provides programmatic access to your entire Craft space - the top-level container for all your documents and organizational structure.

### Space Structure
A Craft space organizes content through:
- **Folders**: Hierarchical folders to organize documents
- **Documents**: Individual documents within locations
- **Blocks**: The content within documents (text, pages, collections, media)
- **Tasks**: Task management across inbox, daily notes, and documents

### Key Concepts
**Locations**: Documents exist in locations. A location is either a folder or one of the built-in locations: 'unsorted' (default for new documents), 'templates', or 'trash' (recently deleted).

**Document IDs**: A document ID is the same as its root block ID. Use a document ID with `GET /blocks` to fetch the document's content.

**Space Discovery**: Use `GET /folders` to see all locations, then `GET /documents` to list documents within a specific location.

**Document Organization**: Documents can be created in, moved between, and deleted from locations. Use folder and document management endpoints to organize your space.

**Tasks**: Tasks can be managed across the space. Use `GET /tasks` with scope filters (inbox, active, upcoming, logbook) to retrieve tasks, and other task endpoints to create, update, or delete them.

### Development Tips
- Start with `GET /folders` to discover all locations in the space
- Use `GET /documents` with a location filter to list documents in a specific location
- Create new locations with `POST /folders`
- Use `POST /documents` to create new documents in a specific location
- Access document content with `GET /blocks?id={documentId}`
- Search across the entire space with `GET /documents/search`
- Use `PUT /documents/move` to move documents between locations
- Manage tasks with `GET /tasks?scope=active` to retrieve due tasks, or use other scopes (inbox, upcoming, logbook)

### Note for AI
When implementing functionality using this API, always make actual calls to these endpoints and verify the responses. Do not simulate or mock the API interactions or use hard-coded values on the client-side - use the real endpoints to ensure proper functionality and data handling.

**IMPORTANT: This is a production server connected to real user data.** Only perform testing operations that can be safely rolled back:

- Safe: Reading data (`GET` requests), creating test content that you delete immediately after
- Safe: Modifying content if you can restore it to its original state
- Safe: Moving blocks if you can move them back to their original position
- Unsafe: Permanent deletions, modifications without backup, or any changes you cannot reverse

Always verify rollback operations work before considering a test complete.

## Endpoints

## Fetch Blocks

`GET /blocks`

Fetches content from any document in the space. Use 'id' query parameter to specify which block to fetch.

Use `Accept` header `application/json` for structured data, `text/markdown` for rendered content.

**Content Rendering:** Text blocks contain markdown formatting and markdown formatted output may include structural tags like `<page></page>`, etc. When displaying content, consider rendering markdown as formatted text or cleaning up the syntax for plain text display.

**Full Space Access:** This connection has access to all documents across all locations in the space. Block links and relations within the space are preserved.

**Tip:** Start with GET /folders to see all locations, then GET /documents to list documents by location. Use document IDs as the 'id' parameter to fetch content.

### Parameters

- **date** (query): string
  Fetches the root page of a Daily Note for the specified date. Accepts ISO format YYYY-MM-DD or relative dates: 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday'.
Mutually exclusive with 'id' - use this to fetch a Daily Note's root page, or use 'id' to fetch a specific block.
- **id** (required) (query): string
  Fetches a specific page block by its ID. Use this when you want to retrieve a particular block directly.
Mutually exclusive with 'date' - omit 'date' entirely when using this parameter.
- **maxDepth** (query): number
  The maximum depth of blocks to fetch. Default is -1 (all descendants). With a depth of 0, only the specified block is fetched. With a depth of 1, only direct children are returned.
- **fetchMetadata** (query): boolean
  Whether to fetch metadata (comments, createdBy, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedAt, createdAt) for the blocks. Default is false.
